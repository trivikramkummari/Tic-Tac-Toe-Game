# Project Title:
Tic-Tac-Toe Game

# Overview:
Created a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place their marks (X or O). The game detects wins by aligning three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and checks for draws when the grid is full with no winner.

# Features:
Game Board: Display a 3x3 grid for gameplay.
Turn Management: Alternate turns between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
Win Detection: Automatically detect and announce when a player wins.
Draw Detection: Recognize when the game ends in a draw.
Reset Option: Allow players to reset the game without refreshing the page.

# Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure the game board and buttons.
CSS: Style the game for visual appeal and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Implement game logic for turn management, win/draw detection, and restart functionality.
