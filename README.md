# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Created a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place their marks (X or O). The game detects wins by aligning three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and checks for draws when the grid is full with no winner.
